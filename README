===========
Compiling
===========

The .cpp and .h files are needed to compile LAMMPS to use the Go model of
Karanicolas and Brooks and the coarse grain surface model of Wei and Knotts.  

In general, the code is complied as described in the LAMMPS documentation.
LAMMPS is constructed so that new functionality can be added by simply
placing new .cpp and .h files in the src/ directory.  Below are more specific 
instructions.

1. Obtain LAMMPS for lammps.sandia.gov
2. Uncompress the .tar file.
3. Copy pair_lj_cut_eten.cpp, pair_lj_cut_eten.h, dihedral_eten.cpp,
   dihedral_eten.h, fix_hwall.cpp, fix_hwall,h, fix_hwall_hydro.cpp, and
   fix_hwall_hydro.h to the src/ directory.
4. Change to the src/ directory.
5. Type make clean-all
6. Type make yes-molecule to include the package for site types
7. Type make serial

The program will compile.

You can include other LAMMPS packages, such as REPLICA, if desired.
You can also compile with mpi or other options.
