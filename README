===========
Compiling
===========

The .cpp and .h files are needed to compile LAMMPS to use the Go model of
Karanicolas and Brooks.  

In general, the code is complied as described in the LAMMPS documentation.
LAMMPS is constructed so that new functionality can be added by simply
placing new .cpp and .h files in the src/ directory.  Below are more specific 
instructions.

1. Obtain LAMMPS for lammps.sandia.gov
2. Uncompress the .tar file.
3. Copy pair_lj_cut_eten.cpp, pair_lj_cut_eten.h, dihedral_eten.cpp, and
   dihedral_eten.h to the src/ directory.
4. Change to the src/ directory.
5. Type make clean-all
6. Type make yes-molecule to include package for site types
7. Type make serial

The program will compile.

You can include other LAMMPS packages, such as REPLICA, if desired.
You can also compile with mpi or other options.

===========
Examples
===========
The 'example' folder contained lammps input files for PDB IDs 1bdd and
1igt.  Representative outputs are also found to check your 
lammps implementation.

-----
1bdd
-----
These files were generated from the go2lammps tool available on the 
svn server.  The PDB was uploaded to the MMTSB Go-model builder and 
the go2lammps tool was used on these files.

-----
1igt
-----
This molecule is an antibody, and the lammps files were generated 
by hand because the MMTSB Go-model builder had trouble converting
the large, multi-chain molecule.
